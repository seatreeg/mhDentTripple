<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Across the last three years, three surveys were taken using almost the exact same methodology. Dental school students were asked to take a set of mental health surveys, and 3 metrics were scored (PHQ9,BURNOUT MINI Z,GAD7) Ids were not taken, and given the size of the school, it is very likely that many of the participants are the same people, so a person may have taken the quiz as a first year in the first survey, a second year in the second survey, and a third year in the third survey, and we would not be able to tell.</p>

<section id="preparation" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparation"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> PREPARATION</h2>
<p>We have separate files with separate schemes for how the data is recorded, and we need to modify the data to all be in the same format. This whole section is that process, but it contains no analysis or plotting. For information to put on the abstract, skip to the PLOTTING and ANALYSIS sections.</p>

<p>We specifically look at two cohorts, the class of 2026 and 2027. Both the classes had significant negative squared terms for study year for the PHQ and GAD scores*, and significant positive terms for the non squared terms study year. The class of 2026 did not have a statistically significant coefficients for the burnout score, but class of 2027 did, and they also had a negative squared term and positive non squared term.</p>
<ul>
<li>note, one significant result (class of 2026 phq squared term) was not significant after doing anti-p-hacking adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR: - people got much worse last year - this year the two cohorts were a bit better than last year in terms of depression (phq) and anxiety (gad), but the scores are still worse than the first year. Evidence for the same pattern for burnout was only found for the class of 2027.</p>
